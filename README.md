# EliteBot

A simple and somewhat elegant Discord bot for calculating maximum damage stats on Elitelupus' Garry's Mod server.




## Usage

Once the bot is running, simply run the `/calculate <DAMAGE> <PERCENTAGE>` command. The arguments can be found on your gun stats UI.

(Damage Location)

[![Percentage  "Percentage location")](https://i.imgur.com/ZJWl0vB.png "Percentage location")
(Percentage Location)

Once the bot is provided this information, the bot will show you the theoretical max reroll the gun can have.

## Installation

First, make sure you have Deno [installed](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/ "installed").

Next simply download the code from the repo and open the .env file in any editor of your choosing, create a Discord bot from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications "Discord Developer Portal"). Paste the bot's token and your server ID into their respective locations in the .env file.

Now simply run the batch file and the bot should come online!
